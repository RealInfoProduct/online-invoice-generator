        <h1>Invoicing Basics</h1>
        <p>
            Understanding the fundamentals of invoicing is essential for freelancers and small business owners to ensure
            accurate, professional, and timely payments. This section of the guide will introduce you to the basics of
            what an invoice is, its crucial components, and the different types of invoices you might use depending on
            your business needs.
        </p>

        <h2>What is an Invoice?</h2>
        <p>
            An invoice is a document sent by a provider of a product or service to the purchaser that specifies the
            amount and cost of products or services provided. It serves as a formal request for payment, detailing the
            transaction between the seller and the buyer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The difference between an invoice and a receipt is significant: an invoice is issued before the payment is
            made, indicating the amount owed, while a receipt is proof of payment and is provided after the transaction
            has been completed.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Invoices</h2>
        <p>
            Different situations and types of transactions require different types of invoices. Understanding when to
            use each can help you manage your finances more effectively:
        </p>

                buyer.

                <span>Proforma Invoice:</span> Sent before the delivery of goods or services as an estimate, not a

                <span>Recurring Invoice:</span> Used for ongoing services, sent at regular intervals (e.g., monthly for

            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Credit Memo:</span> Also known as a credit note, issued when a client has been overcharged or
                returned goods, indicating a credit to their account.
            </li>

            <li>
                <span>Debit Memo:</span> Also known as a debit note, indicates an increase in the amount due, often used
                in cases of undercharging.

                <span>Commercial Invoice:</span> Used for international shipping, providing information for customs
                purposes.

        </ul>

        <p>
            Each of these invoice types serves a specific purpose and choosing the right one depends on the nature of
            the transaction and the relationship with the client. By incorporating these invoicing basics into your
