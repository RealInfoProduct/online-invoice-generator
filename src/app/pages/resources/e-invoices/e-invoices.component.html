                <h1>E-Invoicing: Everything You Should Know About E-Invoices</h1>

                <p>
                    Now that you’ve learned what invoices are, what their desired format is and the elements they should
                    include, it’s time to learn about a mode of invoicing that has been gaining popularity for the past
                    decade or so, called e-invoicing.
                </p>

                <h2>What is e-Invoicing?</h2>
                <p>E-Invoicing is short for electronic invoicing. It is a form of electronic billing used to exchange
                    transactional documents between trading partners, such as customers and their suppliers. In recent
                    years, e-Invoicing has replaced traditional, paper-based invoicing in various business sectors in
                    different parts of the world and is becoming increasingly common. To avoid confusion, it should be
                    noted
                    that a true e-invoice is usually based on Internet web-forms and consists of structured invoice data
                    issued in either an XML or EDI format. While many companies employ a third-party company for their
                    e-Invoicing processes, others rely on an in-house e-Invoicing process.
                </p>

                <h2>Multiple Benefits of e-Invoicing</h2>

                <h4>1) Lower costs</h4>
                <p>The automation of the invoicing process results in significant cost savings. For example, fees
                    relating
                    to processing, delivery, storage, postage, customer support and paper copies have all be shown to
                    decrease upon replacing traditional invoicing with e-Invoicing.
                </p>

                <h4>2) Higher Productivity</h4>
                <p>
                    Not having to rely on paper documents and postage and opting instead for a quick online delivery
                    frees
                    up a lot of time, which can be directed towards other tasks. In addition, e-invoices rarely get
                    mixed up
                    or lost in the mail, reducing associated customer complaints.
                </p>

                <h4>3) Faster payments</h4>
                <p>
                    Sending and receiving e-invoices quickly online means no more mail-related delays. Receiving
                    e-invoices
                    on time also means they can be processed and paid in a timely fashion.
                </p>

                <h4>4) Improved accuracy</h4>
                <p>
                    Before e-Invoicing, the manual process involved in invoicing meant possible data entry errors, which
                    meant invoices often had to be rejected and re-issued. This was an intricate, and time-consuming
                    process. The advanced systems on which e-Invoicing relies significantly reduce the occurrence of
                    such
                    errors.
                </p>

                <h2>Widespread Adoption of e-Invoicing Among European SMEs</h2>
                <p>
                    Europe has embraced rudimentary versions of e-Invoicing since the early 2000s. The efficiencies and
                    cost
                    savings conferred by e-Invoicing are fueling widespread adoption of this electronic business medium.
                    SMEs in particular stand to benefit from adopting this cutting-edge technology to streamline
                    business
                    operations and operate at maximum efficiency. Previously, the most effective medium for transmitting
                    electronic business documentation was EDI (electronic data interchange) inside a VAN (value-added
                    network).
                </p>

                <p>
                    e-Invoicing systems initially faced several challenges in the form of standardization, taxation
                    issues,
                    and frameworks. However, these issues were worked out to ensure synchronicity and congruence across
                    European SMEs. In 2017, the EC mandated the standardization of e-Invoicing via EN 16931-1 (25 YES
                    Votes
                    and No NEGATIVE Votes) and EN 16931-2 (24 YES Votes and No NEGATIVE Votes). This paved the way for
                    the
                    adoption and implementation of e-Invoicing systems throughout Europe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Countries like Slovenia have received CEF funding for e-Invoicing compliance with EU legislation,
                    and
                    much the same is true with Ireland, Poland, and other EU nations. As per Council Directive
                    2010/45/EU
                    (discussed in the next section), the same standard binds all EU member states. This ensures harmony
                    and
                    synchronicity of e-Invoicing, among SMEs.
                </p>

                <h2>The European Standard for e-Invoicing</h2>
                <p>
                    A key indicator of the way in which e-Invoicing is becoming standard around the world is the recent
                    endorsement of the Directive 2014/55/EU by the European Union Parliament and the European Council.
                    After
                    the European Commission had mandated the CEN (European Committee for Standardization) to define the
                    European standard for invoicing, in March 2017 the invoice model and its syntaxes, altogether known
                    as
                    the EN (European Norm) were unanimously approved. The EN is meant to be used for public transaction
                    processes between member states of the European Union.
                </p>

                <h2>Key Features of the European e-Invoicing Standard:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compatible with international e-billing standards</li>
                    <li>Technologically neutral</li>
                    <li>Protective of personal data</li>
                    <li>Supportive of user-friendly, practical, profitable and flexible e-Invoicing systems</li>
                    <li>Consistent with Directive 2006/112/EC</li>
                    <li>Suitable for business transactions between companies</li>
                    <li>Supportive of the needs of small and medium business</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Singapore: A Leader in e-Invoicing</h2>
                <p>
                    Many countries around the world have adopted e-Invoicing in the past few years; however, Singapore
                    is
                    unique in this regard. This Asian Tiger has mandated e-Invoicing for suppliers of the Singaporean
                    government since May 2008.
