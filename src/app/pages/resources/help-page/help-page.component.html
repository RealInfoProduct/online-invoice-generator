            <h3> Making Invoices </h3>

            <p>
                
                Generating invoices is easy! Fill out the invoice template with all the details you want on your
                invoice.
                The invoice editor closely matches what the resulting invoice will look like. Once you have filled in
                the
                invoice template you are ready to download or send your invoice.
            </p>

            <p>
                The download invoice button will be disabled until you fill in your information and your client's
                information into the to/from fields.
            </p>

            <h3>Sending Invoices</h3>
            <p>Invoices can be sent to customers as an e-invoice through the Invoiced network. Your invoices are stored
                securely in the cloud, and you can accept a variety of payment methods that are convenient for your
                customer.
            </p>

            <h3>Downloading Invoices</h3>
            <p>Click the Download Invoice to download a PDF of your invoice. If you made a mistake, don't worry, you can
                go
                back and update the invoice by clicking Edit this invoice. If you do not see your invoice once you click
                download then you should check your Downloads folder.
            </p>

            <h3>Saving Invoices</h3>
            <p>
                Invoices that you download or send are auto-saved to your device's local storage. This allows you to go
                back
                and edit past invoices.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can access past invoices on the History page. Click on a previously generated invoice to open it in
                the
                invoice editor. You can also export all of your invoices to a spreadsheet file by clicking the Export
                button.
            </p>

            <p>
                Individual invoices can be deleted by hovering over the invoice and clicking the X button. Clicking
                Erase
                Everything will erase all saved invoices and any customizations to the invoice template.
            </p>
