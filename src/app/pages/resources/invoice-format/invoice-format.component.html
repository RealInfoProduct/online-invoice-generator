            An invoice is a commercial document that itemizes and records a transaction between a buyer and a
            seller. It is used to request payment for goods or services that have been delivered or provided. A
            well-designed invoice format can help ensure that all necessary information is included, making it
            easier for the buyer to understand and process the invoice.

            The invoice number is a unique identifier for the invoice, which helps both the seller and the buyer
            to track and manage the transaction. The date of the invoice is also important, as it establishes
            when the transaction took place and when payment is due.

            The Bill To and Ship To sections should include the name and address of the buyer and the delivery
            address, respectively. This information is necessary for the seller to know where to send the goods
            or services, and where to send the invoice.

            The Description of Goods or Services section should provide a detailed breakdown of the items being
            invoiced. This should include the quantity, unit price, and any applicable discounts. It is
            important to be as specific as possible, as this will help the buyer to understand exactly what they
            are being charged for.

            The Subtotal section shows the total cost of the goods or services before any taxes or additional
            fees are applied. The Tax section shows the amount of any applicable taxes, such as sales tax or
            value-added tax (VAT). The Shipping or Handling section shows the cost of shipping or handling, if
            applicable.

        <p>

            The Total section shows the total amount due, including all taxes, shipping or handling fees, and
            any other charges. This is the amount that the buyer should pay in order to settle the invoice.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Payment Terms section shows the date by which payment is due, as well as any penalties for late
            payment. It is important to be clear and specific about payment terms, as this will help to avoid
            any misunderstandings or disputes.

            Finally, the Payment Methods section shows the acceptable forms of payment, such as check, credit
            card, or bank transfer. This information is necessary for the buyer to know how to pay the invoice,
