        <hr>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>Welcome to iFree Invoice, where we empower small businesses with efficient invoicing solutions. As you grow
            your venture, understanding Value Added Tax (VAT) becomes crucial. Whether you're a freelancer, a budding
            entrepreneur, or a seasoned business owner, grasping VAT concepts can save you time, money, and headaches.
            In this guide, we'll delve into the essentials of VAT and how it relates to your invoicing processes on
            iFree Invoice.</p>
        <h3>Understanding VAT:</h3>
        <p>VAT is a consumption tax levied on the value added to goods and services at each stage of production or
            distribution. Unlike sales tax, which is typically collected only at the point of sale to the end consumer,
            VAT is collected at every stage of the supply chain. It's important to note that VAT is ultimately borne by
            the end consumer, as businesses collect VAT on behalf of the government and remit it accordingly.
        </p>
        <h3>VAT Rates:</h3>
        <p>VAT rates vary from country to country and sometimes within regions of a country. In general, there are
            standard rates, reduced rates, and zero rates. The standard rate is applied to most goods and services,
            while reduced rates may apply to specific items such as food, books, or public transportation. Zero rates,
            as the name suggests, mean no VAT is charged on those goods or services, but businesses can still claim back
            VAT they've paid on inputs.
        </p>
        <h3>VAT Registration:</h3>
        <p>Whether you need to register for VAT depends on various factors, including your turnover and the rules of the
            country or region where you operate. In many jurisdictions, businesses exceeding a certain turnover
            threshold must register for VAT. However, voluntary registration may be beneficial for smaller businesses,
            allowing them to reclaim VAT on their expenses.
